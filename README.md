**Hello!ðŸ‘‹** Here's a simple project to test myself as I start programming. The goal is to practice features like **sorting random strings from lists, using loops, checking winners, creating a scoreboard, adding difficulty levels, creating tutorials**, and improving the **user experience** in terminal. And, of course, to pratice using **Git and GitHub**.
