# Rock, Papper and Scissors Python Project
**Hello!👋** Here's a simple project to test myself as I start programming. The goal is to practice features like **sorting random strings from lists, using loops, checking winners, creating a scoreboard, adding difficulty levels, creating tutorials**, and improving the **user experience** in terminal. And, of course, to pratice using **Git and GitHub**. 
- [x] Create a tutorial page
- [x] Basic game
- [x] A Mechanic that waits for the player choose, just like in real life
- [x] Checking winners
- [x] Scoreboard
- [ ] Difficulty Levels
